# Version log
I will aim to keep an accurate log of what features to expect in each version before getting there to create a general "roadmap" for the project. This will start out very vague and get more explicit as the project progresses. I'm doing this to create a "sprint" type feel to the project although given that I won't be setting exact timelines (at least to start with) it will be more of an amble...
