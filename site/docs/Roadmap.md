# Version log
I will aim to keep an accurate log of what features to expect in each version before getting there to create a general "roadmap" for the project. This will start out very vague and get more explicit as the project progresses. I'm doing this to create a "sprint" type feel to the project although given that I won't be setting exact timelines (at least to start with) it will be more of an amble...

## 1.0.0
To achieve 1.0.0 it will have to:
* Have a home page displaying all the currently created maps (all stored in localStorage for now, no server)
* Be able to create & edit a map in a new page with the option to:
  * customise road colour
  * customise water colour
  * customise green-space colour
  * define a route to show from one point to another
  * define the color and thickness for the route
  * export the html or vue-component tag that you need to embed in your site
* Have some basic automated testing implemented
* Officially supporting only latest browsers

## 0.0.1
